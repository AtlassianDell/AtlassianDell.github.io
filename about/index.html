      <p>Howdy, I'm KQ4WLC. I am a general class amateur radio operator, so, uh, yeah. I am from the bright, sunny, happy place of Florida. Specifically, the dark, gloomy, very no good place called "Jacksonville." Nonetheless, it's a fine place to live. I am in high school, likely obvious by my tone. Unfortunately, almost none of my projects are actually finished, so literally do not count on me for anything to be done.</p>
