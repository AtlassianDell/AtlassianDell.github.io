    <p>Howdy, I'm KQ4WLC. I'm a General class Amateur operator, calculator enthusiast, avgeek, and "programmer". I've been focusing on the TI89 Titanium as of recent, and I've specifically been trying to work on an HID driver for it.<br> I aim to better <i>my</i> personal experience, and it sometimes makes other people have a better experience.</p>
