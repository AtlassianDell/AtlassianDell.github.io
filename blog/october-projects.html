        <p>Okay so I don't really do this sort of stuff often so apologies in advance if I sound like I don't know how to write because I don't. This is primarily a collection of my projects I have ongoing and their problems. No pictures as I'm too lazy to take some rn</p>

        <h2>68008 test</h2>
        <p>I probably enjoy the 68ks a bit too much, but I overlooked an unfortunate situation where I only have 8 bit data bus chips. I ordered one off of eBay and it looks legit, but I cannot get it to work. For that matter most of everything seems to not work, and because there is a disheartening lack of people who even know what a 68008 is, I have to deal with either making my own test kit or just trust my gut that they're functional. Idk.</p>
        <p><br>Alright that was really the only one. Yeah.</p>

        <h2>Looking for buyer of Motorola Spectra D43KX/DA3KX VHF Low split w/ A3 head</h2>
        <p>I don't need this thing anymore and I need it gone, but obviously for a price. I'll take offers by email, but asking price is $70 USD plus shipping. Ships in the USA only.</p>
