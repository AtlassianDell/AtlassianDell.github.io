        <p>So, I've decided to set up a blog. I'll be honest, you won't see me post here much. This website is entirely static, and it's mostly a place for me to put my thoughts and projects.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>There may be some irrelevant posts, maybe some photos or just random musings. I'll use this space to share my weird and kooky adventures, and whatever else comes to mind.</p>
